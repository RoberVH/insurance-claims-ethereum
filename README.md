This software is developed for Team participating on ETHOnline Hackathon + Summits October 2nd - 30th, 2020
(https://ethonline.org/)


<h1> Description of Project</h1>

A patient goes to a pharmacy store to fulfill a prescription, the pharmacy will supply medicine and  claim payment from  Insurance Company.  Pharmacy will issue and sign a Transaction and ask patient to sign it too through their smart phone. 

The multisigned Tx is to be sent to a  a smart contract established prior between Pharmacy Company and  Insurancer, the contract will  validate credentials (patient and Physician), medication coverage,  and make automatic payment.

Smart Contract will also record the electronic Health Record on the cloud and grant permissions to patient. Patient will be able to disclose their prescription information to other physicians in the future or be able to sell it at decentralized data markets to Big Pharma / Marketing companies etc.
Insurancer can be a traditional company or a DAO Insurance.

Insurancer  shall declare catalogs covering their  program coverage, patients and doctors allowed, medication covered, but can't modify coverage during the period of insurance coverage.

Insurance DAO. Its going to be a DAO which received initial ICO funding and monthly payment from anyone wanting to buy medicine insurance. The DAO will have to invest automatically the money received to cover for future payments and yield farming for stakeholders (as a traditional Insurancer will do).

<h1> How It's Made</h1>

Smart contract for Pharma and Insurancer shall be a factory contract  allowing to instantiate a particular contract along their catalogs addresses. This contract shall validate the information before authorize payment and do the payment. 

This contract shall  record prescription information and grant permission to patient. 
Patient will be able then to disclose prescription records later to doctors in future encounters or even sale their information in Decrntralized Data Markets.
